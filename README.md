# Day-Planner-for-planning-a-better-day
This program is a functioning planner for typical business hours.  It allows the user to type in plans for each hour, click a save button, and have those plans persist, thanks to local storage.  It displays the current date and time at the top, which updates every second. The rows for each hour of the day are color-coded to represend past hours, the present hour, and future hours.  When the hour changes, the color coding of the rows will change on it's own without requiring the page to be refreshed.
